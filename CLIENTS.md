## Other Clients

### JetBrains

To connect a JetBrains IDE with the Docker Language Server, you can use the [LSP4IJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23257-lsp4ij) plugin from Red Hat. It is an open source LSP client for JetBrains IDEs. Follow the documentation [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/lsp4ij/blob/main/docs/user-defined-ls/docker-language-server.md) to get started.
